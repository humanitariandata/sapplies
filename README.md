# sApplies

sApplies helps organizers of relief efforts during disaster recovery to manage needs donations of residents a relief operation supported by a Facebook-page.

The developed prototype consists of a few components. First, a Facebook page tab app to help and guide suppliers on the Facebook page of the relief initiative to offer their help. Second, the web app that allows the initiator of the relief effort to connect the Facebook page tab app to the relief effortâ€™s Facebook-page. Through this web app an initiator can also add (specified) requests for help which will be shown in the Facebook page tab app.
This way the visitors of the Facebook-page are able to offer their help in a structured way. The initiator of the action and related Facebook page, is able to manage needs and incoming offers using the web app.
